# Page snapshots and local recovery

Verification evidence and untested provider boundaries are recorded in [Verification](page-snapshot-verification.md).

## Page capture and automatic export fallback

Open a supported conversation (Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, or Grok), then choose **Capture page snapshot** in the extension popup. When a parsed conversation cannot pass complete-export verification, the regular export button also captures the page automatically: Markdown downloads directly, while PDF opens a stable preview tab where you choose **Download PDF**. It does not silently turn a snapshot into a complete archive. This fallback does not add history-off conversations to scheduled or bulk exports. This captures only conversation content already loaded and readable in the current page DOM. It is available even when provider verification has not completed, but **it does not verify the complete conversation**. Unloaded messages and external attachment contents may be absent. The generation status is recorded as generating, idle, or unknown; it does not prove completeness.

The captured record is fixed: closing or navigating the source tab does not change it. Copy Markdown, save Markdown, or open its preview and choose Download PDF. PDF does not start automatically. The page preview cache lasts at most one hour and holds at most 20 entries, 1 MiB each and 2 MiB overall. If output or privacy options change for an existing capture, recapture before opening another preview or PDF; the cache will not silently reuse different options. A missing or expired cache entry cannot reconstruct the original capture from the provider. Markdown and PDF snapshots do not include ZIP archives, raw provider payloads, or tool traces.

Safe-share uses heuristic credential redaction. It cannot guarantee removal of every secret; inspect the result before sharing. Images with external URLs may request their host when rendered, and offline image availability is not guaranteed.

## Optional recovery drafts

**Local recovery is off by default and currently Gemini-only.** Enable it for a conversation in the snapshot panel. The extension saves an initial checkpoint, then captures observed changes after a 2.5-second debounce, with a 15-second maximum wait. These are page observations, **not** provider-verified history or an undo timeline. A failed save retains the previous successful checkpoint; it cannot roll back through unlimited revisions or restore a provider conversation.

Drafts stay in browser-managed local storage, not cloud sync. Default limits are 1 MiB per draft, 4 MiB total, and 20 drafts, retained for seven days after their last save. On the recovery page, choose **Keep drafts for**: 7, 30, 90 days, or **Until I delete them**. Cleanup may run later if the browser is closed or storage fails; a settings-read failure must not trigger expiry.

Choose **Enable expanded local storage** to remove the application byte limits. Chrome/Edge ask for the optional `unlimitedStorage` permission; Firefox includes this permission in its installation manifest because it cannot be requested optionally, but still requires this application opt-in. Expanded storage is not infinite disk space: browser/disk failures can still pause saving, and the 20-draft limit remains. Returning to default limits or revoking permission retains existing drafts, including oversized ones; a subsequent save may pause. Unexpired drafts are never silently evicted to make room. Delete unwanted drafts explicitly or adjust retention.

The recovery page lists drafts and lets you save Markdown directly, open a fixed preview, or delete them. Direct Markdown saving works without the temporary preview's 1 MiB entry cap, so large drafts remain exportable. Preview/PDF still use the separate bounded temporary cache. **Stop protection** retains saved content. **Delete** or **Delete all drafts** removes the content and stops protection for affected drafts; stale writes must not recreate deleted drafts. After a browser restart, protection is paused and does not silently resume. Service-worker suspension and waking during the same browser session are different from a browser restart.

This opt-in does not disable older automatic DOM fallback caching used elsewhere in the extension. See [Privacy Policy](../PRIVACY.md) for all storage and credential behavior. If a checkpoint is too large or local storage fails, save Markdown directly when possible.
